# Maria Reyna's Portfolio
Hi my name is Maria Reyna and this is a collection of my past projects I have done.
The Decision maker app is an one of my first apps I created using Swift, and it is still being updated as I find more things to add. The app is simple you can put up to 6 options and it will randomly choose one of the six options you entered.
The Climb project is a group project I worked on as the lead developer and its a math game to practice addition. There are still things to work on for that app as well that I plan on working towards.
