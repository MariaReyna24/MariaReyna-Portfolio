# Maria Reyna's Portfolio
Hi my name is Maria Reyna and this is a collection of my past projects I have done:

### Decision Maker App: 
The Decision Maker app is one of my first projects developed using Swift. It allows users to input up to six options and randomly selects one of them, making it a handy tool for quick decision-making. I plan on returning to this app at one point to make it on the app store

### Climb Math Game:
Climb is a math game where I served as the lead developer in a team setting. Initially focused on addition, Since first uploading to the app store with Climb 1.0 in June of 2023, I have began to work on a major update with Climb 1.5 including all four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, at this momnet I am working on a new game mode called "frenzy mode," which will add an extra layer of excitement and challenge to the game by shuffling all the opeerations and giving you a random one each question.

### Calculaor App: 
Another fun app I worked on I have this calculator app that was inspired by the iOS calculator. I basically recreated it so it also has the addtion, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Operations with decimals works. I plan on making sure you can add whole numbers and decimals in my next move on the calculator app.

### Modality 
This is a project I created to understand modality regarding sheets and alerts on my own, and later I turned it into a learning experience for junior learners so they could also get an understanding of how @State works with modals. It's a simple project where you can learn how to implement alerts and sheet views.
